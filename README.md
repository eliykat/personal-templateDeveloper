# Template Developer

Template Developer is an Add-in for Microsoft Word that helps you quickly create automated document templates for [Actionstep](https://www.actionstep.com/).

**The problem:** Actionstep users have to manually look up and type in mergefield codes when creating Actionstep templates. These can often be difficult to learn, especially for non-technical users, and it is easy to make typographical errors.  For example: `[[FirstInitialWithLastName|pt=Selected__Participant|ifnull=ignore]]` or `[[SP_SalePurchaseDate|fm=%-e_%B_%Y]]`. This becomes more complicated again when using `IF` or `REPEAT` blocks in the template.

**The solution:** A taskpane in Microsoft Word which lets the user select mergefields and common options and automatically insert them into the template.
